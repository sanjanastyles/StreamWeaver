**Features:**

* **Browse and Search Shows:** Explore a comprehensive catalog of shows with filters by genre, platform, release date, and more.
* **User Accounts and Watchlists:** Create a user account to maintain personalized watchlists and track your viewing progress.
* **Ratings and Reviews:**  Share your thoughts on shows with a rating system and write reviews to guide other users. (Optional: Implement a recommendation system based on watch history and user reviews)
